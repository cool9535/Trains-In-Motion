<h2>Art:</h2>
<ul>
<li> Models must match the Mod's Art-style.</li>
<li> Format is limited to <b>.java</b> models only; you can use tools such as BDCraft Cubik, SMP Toolbox, Technie or even writing it manually.</li>
<li> SMP Toolbox models must not use Shape, we have dropped support of the function for various reasons, instead use ShapeBoxes.</li>
<li> Model scale is <b>0.75 meters, or, 12 microblocks, wide for the wheel base</b>, In other words they must fit on minecart rails. It is reccomended the body should be 1.25+ meters, or, 20+ microblocks, wide.</li>
<li> Technie models are limited to 512x512 base resolution for textures, regardless of if you actually need that much space.</li>
<li> Textures must be in <b>.png</b> format. And are preferred to be at 4 times the resolution of the texture base size defined in the model (this is 4096x4096 in most cases).</li>
<li> Audio must be in <b>.ogg</b> format and no more than 192kb/s.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Code:</h2>
<ul>
<li> Code must be well optimized.</li>
<li> Setting up the project for InteliJ was made easy with the setup.bat file. Otherwise this project will follow standard Forge conventions. See
<a href="http://www.minecraftforge.net/wiki/Installation/Source">http://www.minecraftforge.net/wiki/Installation/Source</a></li>
<li> Regarding new features/behavior changes, please submit a new Suggestion to the issue tracker before you write any code.</li>

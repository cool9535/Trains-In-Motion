<h2>Code:</h2>
<ul>
<li> Code will be reviewed for optimizations and structure, if the issues are too large they will need to be fixed.</li>
<li> Code requires Intellij 2018, available <a href ="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/other.html">here</a>, and will not work with 2019 or newer, NOTE: 2018 can be installed alongside 2019 without any conflictions. NOTE 2:Eclipse should work, but is unsupported because I don't know how to use it. </li>
<li> Code setup also requires the setup from the "Compiling a .jar pre-release" section.</li>
<li> Regarding new features/behavior changes, please submit a new Suggestion to the issue tracker, or ask me on discord, before you write any code.</li>
<li> Workspace setup may use the idea option in the setup.bat, or by entering the following command manually, without quotes. NOTE: Powershell is not supported, use CMD. And do not run as admin/sudo.</li>
<li> windows: "gradlew setupDecompWorkspace --refresh-dependencies idea" Linux/mac: "./gradlewLinux setupDecompWorkspace --refresh-dependencies idea"
</ul>
<h2> Compiling a .jar pre-release:</h2>
<ul>
<li> Compiling requires java 1.8, available for windows <a href ="https://filehippo.com/download_java_development_kit_64/86378/">here</a>. For Linux and Mac use OpenJDK. An Oracle link was not provided due to Oracle restricting various versions to buisness accounts only.</li>
<li> compiling also requires this java version as your system default, in windows this is done by going to Enviornment Variables in Advanced System Settings, and adding or changing "JAVA_HOME" to the install path of jdk 8.</li>
<li> windows: "gradlew setupDecompWorkspace --refresh-dependencies build" Linux/mac: "./gradlewLinux setupDecompWorkspace --refresh-dependencies build"</li>
<li> the resulting .jar file will appear in the folder /build/libs</li>
